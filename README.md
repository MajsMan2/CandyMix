# CandyMix

In Denmark, "bland selv slik" is a big thing. On a friday evening, both families with children, 
and Noname who wants to see the big boxing match are gathering at the local "bland selv slik"-store, to get snacks for the evening.
Imagine if the trip to the candy-store can be replaced by an app, so that the user can order "bland selv slik" in the comfort of his/hers own home, 
or on the train ride home from work, and get it delivered right to your door. This is now possible with the creation of "CandyMix".

Moscow:
M(ust have): Intuitive interface/menu, ability to choose which (and how much) candy you want, cart, order button, ability to create profile, login screen
S(hould have):Categories (brand or flavour), streamlined user experience(it should have a color-theme and so on througout the app), 
C(ould have): Ability to customize profile for more userinteraction, candy-community, collaboration with Just Eat or Wolt, 
W(ill not have): fully integrated payment system, the right prices on candy, all the needed security

I think the intuitive interface/menu system implemented in the system is pretty well thought out, and easy to use. The ability to choose which candy, 
and how much you want was implemented in the design, but not fully realized in the coding. It is possible to create a profile, and this is possible through the login screen.
Categories was a feature until the last days of the project, and the streamlined user experience is pretty well integrated. 
It does not have the could have, and will not have features.
