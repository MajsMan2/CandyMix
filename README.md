# CandyMix

In Denmark, "bland selv slik" is a big thing. On a friday evening, both families with children, 
and Noname who wants to see the big boxing match are gathering at the local "bland selv slik"-store, to get snacks for the evening.
Imagine if the trip to the candy-store can be replaced by an app, so that the user can order "bland selv slik" in the comfort of his/hers own home, 
or on the train ride home from work, and get it delivered right to your door. This is now possible with the creation of "CandyMix".

Moscow:
M(ust have): Intuitive interface/menu, ability to choose which (and how much) candy you want, cart, order button, ability to create profile, login screen
S(hould have):Categories (brand or flavour), streamlined user experience(it should have a color-theme and so on througout the app), 
C(ould have): Ability to customize profile for more userinteraction, candy-community, collaboration with Just Eat or Wolt, 
W(ill not have): fully integrated payment system, the right prices on candy, all the needed security
